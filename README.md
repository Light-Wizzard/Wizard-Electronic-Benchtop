# Wizard Electronic Benchtop

From a beginner to a professional Electronics Technition or Engineer, you will need Electronic Test Equipment, and we want it all in one equpiment case, 
so that is what this Project is all about.

All equipment functions must be Single-Board Solutions (SBS) that can be upgraded.

The following is a list of all the Functions this case will handle:

* Mixed Signal Oscilloscope
* Spectrum Analyzer
* Protocol Analyzer: WAN, LAN, PAN, and Wireless Networks, USB, CAN, I2C, SPI and eSPI
* Logic Analyzer
* Power Supply: Variable Isolation Transformer
* Waveform Generator
* Frequency Counter
* LCR Meter
* Component Tester for Semiconductors
* Vector Signal Analyzer
* Time-Domain Reflectometer

This SBS list is not set in stone.

The case must be able to hold all these Single-Board Solutions (SBS),
and the layout must have the Power Supply on the bottom, 
and you must ensure it has RF shilding, so it does not interfer with other SBS,
this is the same for all SBS.
